# MassFolderCreatorPy
A simple python script that mass creates folders from a given file extension.

The folders that are created retain the name of the file. For example if you choose .txt, "Afile.txt" will create a folder named "Afile".
Note that the file will be moved inside the folder. This is very useful for sorting out movie libraries.
